                        Iâ€™m Aditya Mallick, a second-year B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering (Artificial Intelligence) at GITA Autonomous College, Bhubaneswar. As a passionate learner in the field of software development and artificial intelligence, I am currently focused on building a strong foundation in Full-Stack Development and AI implementation.

                        I have hands-on experience participating in hackathons, where I learned the importance of effective collaboration, problem-solving, and project management in a team environment. These experiences have enhanced my ability to work under pressure and contribute meaningfully to team-driven goals.

                        At present, I am exploring how to implement AI-driven workflows, automations, and agentic systems using pretrained large language models (LLMs). While I have not yet gained industry-level experience, I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my technical knowledge, gain practical exposure, and continue improving through real-world challenges.
