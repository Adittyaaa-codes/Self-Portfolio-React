                            Hello! I'm Aditya Mallick, from Bhubaneswar, Odisha. I am a Full Stack Developer currently pursuing my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. I love building web applications, as well as exploring the world of artificial intelligence.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My journey into coding began with a curiosity to understand how things work behind the scenes on the web. Over time, I have honed my skills in various technologies including React, Node.js, and MongoDB for full stack development. Additionally, I am deeply interested in AI and its potential to revolutionize various industries.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I'm not coding, I enjoy staying updated with the latest tech trends, contributing to open-source projects, and collaborating with fellow developers. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and take on challenging projects that push my boundaries.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate or just say hello!
                        </p>
